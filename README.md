# Week 1 Assessment

### Setup
* Fork this repository
* You may make edits directly in github
* For the Exercise section, you will want to be logged in to [replit](https://replit.com)

## Questions (10 Points)

1. Define HTTP and why it's important.
   * HTTP is a protocol that allows data transfer on the internet. Specifically, HTTP is the protocol used that can transmit information from the client to the server, and the server to the client.
     * Without HTTP that connection could not be made, and therefore webpages would not appear, links wouldn't work, and no interaction could occur.

2. Using [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings) Create a diagram of the request and response cycle when a user visits turing.edu. Include clear labels for all components. Put the link to your drawing below. (3 points possible)
   * https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1UCrVHbaW7iRq-bpe92Bv2ZZCBFa8q6kFrszUsXeBJyw/edit?usp=sharing

3. Describe two parts of every HTTP request.
   * Every HTTP request MUST contain a header that contains control information, but there is also a body that can be sent containing more data in relation to the header, though this piece is NOT mandatory.

4. How do you describe the difference between HTML and CSS? use an analogy or an example in your answer.
   * HTML is the structure of a webpage, but CSS is the design. For instance, if I'm baking a cake I must first start creating the base and structure of the cake(HTML), before I move on to the icing and toppings(CSS)
     * HTML = structure
     * CSS = design

5. How can the chrome dev tools help with writing html and css?
   * Chrome dev tools allow us to check how professional developers are designing these high-end websites, and on top of this we can make changes that our client will see immediately.
     * With dev tools open, any changes that are made stay client-side and can be erased with a simple refresh, allowing us to tweak various aspects on the webpage, or change the entire thing.

6. How do you open the chrome dev tools?
    1. F12
    2. Right-click -> inspect
    3. 3 dots -> more tools -> dev tools
    4. ctrl + shift + i

7. Why is it important to use semantic HTML tags?
    * Semantic tags are much more unique sections of HTML, this allows the developer to easily see what area is being affect by glancing at its tag, as opposed to only using <div> which is non-specific and takes longer to understand.
    * Along with aiding the developer, semantic tags allow the server to read through the code, making search engines understand our website easier. 

8. What are the three components of the box model?
    In order from center-out
    1. Content
    2. Padding - space around the content but inside the border
    3. Border - typically a box ( can be others ) that surrounds the padding
    4. Margin - an empty space that must be respected ( unless written otherwise ) so other objects do not overlap.

## Exercise (10 Points)

* Create a new HTML/CSS/JS replit
* Using HTML and CSS, replicate as closely as possible the site shown below
* You must demonstrate the following:
  * Two types of header tags
  * A list
  * A semantic html element
  * A Link
  * A paragraph tag
  * A title
  * Changing the background color of an element
  * Targeting an element in css using an id
  * Targeting an element in css using the html tag
  * Adding margin or padding to an element
* When finished, add a link to your Replit here: <A link to your repl here>
